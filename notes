Ideas:
#try rounding to the nearest tenth and looking at data with a histogram
#try ranking data from smallest to highest
#boxplot to see how data behaves 
#look at the way the data values group together
#look at the mean and find the CLT,ranges,variances,standard deviations
#try comparison by depth
#Put data into context-
#put health criteria on x axis and sample averages on y axis

Observaions:
1. anomalies in chla
2. chla box plot- datat not behaving well 
3. pyhco box plt- a little better bevaved but still anomolies

Errors:
* trouble with doing a density plat: plot(density(log1p(dat2015$chla_ugl))) Error in density.default(log1p(dat2015$chla_ugl)) : 
  'x' contains missing values
  
*  hist(log1p(dat2015$phyco_ugl)) Warning message: In log1p(dat2015$phyco_ugl) : NaNs produced
