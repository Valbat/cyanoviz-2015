#try rounding to the nearest tenth and looking at data with a histogram
#try ranking data from smallest to highest
#boxplot to see how data behaves
#look at the way the data values group together
#look at the mean and find the CLT,ranges,variances,standard deviations
#try comparison by depth
#Put data into context-
#put health criteria on x axis and sample averages on y axis
