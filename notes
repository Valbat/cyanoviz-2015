Ideas:
#try rounding to the nearest tenth and looking at data with a histogram
#try ranking data from smallest to highest
#boxplot to see how data behaves 
#look at the way the data values group together
#look at the mean and find the CLT,ranges,variances,standard deviations
#try comparison by depth
#Put data into context-
#put health criteria on x axis and sample averages on y axis

#look at the CLT
#Occurrances of sample analysis (compare highest analysis with date and location) 
#look at the highest 10 sample analysis per state by time 
#then plot against health criteria

#trying incorporating other monitoring data. Lakes with blooms, look at P, N, FE, optimum temp range, turbidity.



Observaions:
1.na's in station_id, station_descrip, sample-method, sample_depth,dilution, water_temp(1185),Chla (69),phyco (2)
2. anomalies in phyco
3. chla box plot- data not behaving well 
4. pyhco box plot- a little better bevaved but still anomolies
5. mean chla [1] 0.7994273
6. max chla [1] 19.26
7. min [1] 0
8. mean phyco[1] 14.47567
9. max phyco[1] 687.86
10. min phyco [1] -17.16 (0.05 for phyco>0.01)
11.SD chla [1] 1.286419
12 SD phyco [1] 50.57064
13. IQR [1] 0.59
14. IQR [1] 7.32
15. RIWW has really high numbers on 8/21?? ranging from 7-687

16. data.frame 2792 obs.of 30 variables
17. Dilution column needs clean up
18. Most of the samples were taken with Beagle, only 13 other. 
20. Took a look at duplication of waerbody names in open refine and only one possible duplication (Lake Gardner(NH) & Gardner Lake (CT))
    so can work off of waterbody names. 
21. Row 359 has a sample depth of 22, only one that is more than 5 in the data set

Errors:
* error with creating density polt for phyco-resolved

*  hist(log1p(dat2015$phyco_ugl)) Warning message: In log1p(dat2015$phyco_ugl) : NaNs produced-resolved



R questions
1. Is there a R equation for calculating the CLT?
2. I made a data frome of descending order of chla and phyco and when I merged the two they did not keep the descending order. 
Why? Because I merged by State. Is there a way to merge by descending order? all set
